      "value": "One of the primary roles of sleep is to allow the body to repair and regenerate, helping to maintain a healthy immune system. Melatonin, a hormone released during sleep, has been found to have powerful antioxidant properties, which can help fight off harmful free radicals that can damage cells and lead to disease. Moreover, sleep plays a crucial role in regulating the body's metabolism, including the hormones that control hunger and appetite. Therefore, disruption of the sleep-wake cycle can have a significant impact on dietary choices and can contribute to overeating and weight gain."
