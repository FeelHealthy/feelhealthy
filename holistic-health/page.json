It emphasizes the interconnectedness of all aspects of life and offers a more balanced approach to health than conventional medicine. Holistic practices include natural remedies, mindful nutrition, stress reduction techniques, and mindfulness practices like meditation and yoga. These practices promote self-care and a balanced lifestyle, supporting the bodyâ€™s natural healing abilities. On feelhealthy.github.io, we offer information and resources to help you achieve a more holistic approach to your own health and wellbeing."
