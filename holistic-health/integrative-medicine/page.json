  "about": "Integrative Medicine is a patient-centered approach that combines conventional medicine with complementary and alternative therapies to support the body's natural healing process. It seeks to address the root causes of disease by treating patients as a whole person, considering their unique physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. By incorporating practices like acupuncture, nutrition, exercise, massage, and meditation, Integrative Medicine aims to provide a personalized and comprehensive approach to healthcare that can improve overall health and quality of life. At Wellness Synthesis, we provide information and resources on Integrative Medicine to help individuals make informed decisions about their healthcare and wellness journey."
