Additionally, the practitioner's ability to effectively communicate with the patient and adapt treatment plans to the patient's individual needs can improve outcomes. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to prioritize building strong relationships with their patients in order to optimize the effectiveness of integrative medicine."
