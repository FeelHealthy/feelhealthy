These oils are extracted from plants and contain the concentrated scent or essence of the plant.

      "value": "One way that essential oils are used in aromatherapy is through inhalation. When we inhale essential oils, the scent molecules travel through our nasal passages and stimulate our olfactory system. This can help to improve mood and reduce stress and anxiety. Essential oils can also be applied topically to the skin, or used in massage therapy. When the oils are absorbed through the skin, they can help to ease muscle pain and reduce inflammation. Some essential oils, like lavender, chamomile, and bergamot, are known for their calming properties and can be particularly beneficial for improving sleep quality."

This experience led him to study the therapeutic benefits of essential oils and to develop the concept of aromatherapy."
