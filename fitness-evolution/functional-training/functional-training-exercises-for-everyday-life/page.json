      "value": "Functional training is a type of exercise that's designed to improve overall health, fitness, and wellness by enhancing your body's ability to perform everyday activities. It's a method of training that focuses on movements that mimic those we use in our daily lives, such as standing, walking, bending, and lifting. Rather than isolating individual muscle groups like traditional weightlifting, functional training aims to train multiple muscle groups at once to improve muscular balance, coordination and overall fitness. This form of exercise can be done with bodyweight, resistance bands, kettlebells, or free weights."

      "type": "p",
      "value": "Functional training is a type of exercise that involves movements that mimic everyday activities or sports-specific actions. It focuses on improving and strengthening the body's ability to carry out these activities efficiently and safely. Rather than isolating specific muscles, functional training combines various muscle groups in a way that challenges the entire body to work together to perform the desired movement. This type of training improves overall functional strength, flexibility, and balance, and it can help reduce the risk of injury during daily activities or sports."

    {
      "type": "p",
      "value": "One of the primary benefits of functional training is that it improves overall functional mobility. This means that your body is better able to move in the way it was designed to move. By strengthening muscles that are used for everyday activities, such as bending, lifting, and reaching, functional training can help you move more freely and with less pain or discomfort. Additionally, when you move with better alignment and form, you reduce the strain on certain areas of the body, such as the back or knees, which can also help reduce the risk of injury."

    {
      "type": "p",
      "value": "Another benefit of functional training is that it can improve your performance in sports or other physical activities. By training the body to move more efficiently and to control its movements through various planes of motion, you can become a stronger and more agile athlete. This can help you perform better on the field, court, or in any other physical activity you enjoy. Additionally, functional training can help you recover faster from injuries so you can get back to doing what you love sooner rather than later."

It refers to a type of exercise that uses movements that mimic daily activities or sports-specific movements to increase strength, flexibility, balance, and endurance.
