      "value": "Functional training is a type of exercise that focuses on mimicking movements and actions that are commonly found in everyday activities or sports. By training the body to perform specific movements with better form and efficiency, sportspeople can develop a better sense of balance, stability, and body control. Rather than working individual muscles or muscle groups in isolation, functional training involves incorporating multiple muscle groups at once to create a more well-rounded and functional workout."

      "value": "One of the major advantages of functional training for sportspeople is injury prevention. By focusing on movements that mimic those that are performed during sports, athletes can prepare their bodies to handle the stresses and strains that come with physical activity. For example, a soccer player might focus on exercises that strengthen their core and lower body, which are both areas that are heavily utilized during a game. By doing so, they can reduce the likelihood of common injuries such as sprains, strains, and tears."
