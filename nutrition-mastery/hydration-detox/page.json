Staying hydrated is crucial for our body's proper functioning, and the lack of water can lead to dehydration, fatigue, and other health problems. Additionally, electrolytes play a vital role in hydration, as they help regulate fluid balance, nerve, and muscle function. Moreover, detoxing is a process of removing toxins from the body, which can help boost energy levels, improve immune function, and aid in weight loss.
