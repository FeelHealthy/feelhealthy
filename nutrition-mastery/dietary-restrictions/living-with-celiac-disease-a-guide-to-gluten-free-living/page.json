      "value": "Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the small intestine. It is caused by a reaction to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. When someone with celiac disease eats gluten, it triggers an immune response that damages the lining of the small intestine. This damage can make it difficult for the body to absorb nutrients from food, which can result in malnutrition, anemia, and other serious health problems."
    },
    {
      "type": "p",
      "value": "Living with celiac disease can be challenging, as gluten is present in many common foods. People with celiac disease must follow a strict gluten-free diet to manage their symptoms and avoid complications. This means avoiding wheat, barley, and rye, as well as staying away from products that contain these ingredients, such as bread, pasta, and cereal. They must also be careful when eating out or traveling, as cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods."

      "value": "Celiac disease can impact many aspects of life beyond just diet. For example, people with celiac disease may experience fatigue, joint pain, and skin rashes. They may also be at increased risk for certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma. Additionally, celiac disease can affect mental health, as it can be difficult to navigate social situations and cope with the stress of managing the condition. However, with proper management and support from healthcare providers and loved ones, people with celiac disease can live full and healthy lives."

      "value": "Gluten is a protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. It is responsible for the elasticity and stretchiness of dough, which gives baked goods their desirable texture. Gluten is commonly used in many processed foods such as bread, pasta, and cereal. However, for individuals with celiac disease, gluten can cause severe damage to the small intestine and lead to malabsorption of nutrients."

    {
      "type": "p",
      "value": "Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population worldwide. When individuals with celiac disease consume gluten, their immune system mistakenly attacks the small intestine, causing inflammation and damage to the villi, tiny finger-like projections that line the gut. This damage can lead to malabsorption of nutrients and result in several health problems such as anemia, osteoporosis, and fatigue. The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet."

      "value": "Gluten sensitivity or non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a condition in which individuals experience gastrointestinal symptoms after consuming gluten-containing foods. Unlike celiac disease, there is no immune system involvement or damage to the gut lining. Symptoms of gluten sensitivity may include bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation. However, diagnosing gluten sensitivity can be challenging as symptoms are not specific to the condition, and there are currently no reliable biomarkers to confirm the diagnosis."

      "value": "Eliminating gluten from your diet may seem daunting at first, but it can have numerous benefits for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye - common ingredients in many foods. While some people can process gluten without issue, others may experience digestive problems, fatigue, joint pain, and other symptoms. For those with celiac disease, consuming gluten can even damage the small intestine over time. By eliminating gluten from your diet, you may experience improved digestion, increased energy levels, and reduced inflammation. It's important to work with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to ensure you are still getting all the necessary nutrients in your diet without gluten-containing foods."

      "value": "One of the biggest challenges in eliminating gluten from your diet is finding alternative sources of carbohydrates. Wheat, barley, and rye are commonly used in bread, pasta, and baked goods. Luckily, many gluten-free alternatives are now available in stores and online, such as brown rice, quinoa, and buckwheat. It's also important to read food labels carefully, as gluten can hide in unexpected places such as sauces, seasonings, and processed foods. When dining out, don't be afraid to ask your server about gluten-free options or to make modifications to your meal."

Gluten-free products are often higher in calories, sugar, and fat than their gluten-containing counterparts. It's important to maintain a balanced and varied diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. A gluten-free diet can also be expensive, so it's helpful to plan ahead and budget accordingly. Remember, a healthy diet is all about balance and moderation â€“ eliminating gluten is just one piece of the puzzle."

It can cause digestive problems and other health issues in individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy. However, even people without these conditions have started to avoid gluten due to its growing reputation as an unhealthy ingredient.
