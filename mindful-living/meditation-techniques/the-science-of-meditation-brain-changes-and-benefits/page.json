      "type": "p",
      "value": "One of the most well-known effects of meditation on the brain is the increase in gray matter volume in several regions, including the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus. Gray matter is the part of the brain that contains neurons, the cells that transmit information. These regions are involved in various cognitive processes, such as decision making, attention, and learning, as well as emotional regulation and memory. Scientists believe that the increase in gray matter volume is due to neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain to change and adapt in response to experiences."

    {
      "type": "p",
      "value": "In addition to changes in brain structure, meditation also affects brain function. Studies have shown that the brains of experienced meditators have increased connectivity between brain regions that are involved in controlling attention and self-awareness. This increased connectivity is thought to improve the ability to focus attention and stay present in the moment, while reducing distractions and mind-wandering. Furthermore, meditation has been found to reduce activity in the default mode network, a set of brain regions that are most active when a person is not focused on the outside world. This reduction in activity is associated with decreased mind-wandering and self-referential thinking, as well as improved emotional regulation and self-awareness."
