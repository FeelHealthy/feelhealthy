Many of us are used to eating until we feel stuffed, or eating according to a set schedule, rather than listening to our bodies' natural signals. To practice mindful eating, try pausing mid-meal to assess how hungry you still feel. If you're no longer hungry, it might be time to stop eating. Similarly, if you're eating when you're not really hungry, try to tune in to what your body is telling you and adjust accordingly. This can help you build a healthier relationship with food and avoid overeating."

This approach is based on the concept of mindfulness, which involves being present in the moment and paying attention to your thoughts and feelings without judgment.

When you eat too quickly, your brain doesn't have time to register that you're full, so you end up eating more than you need. By slowing down and paying attention to the taste and texture of each bite, you can enjoy your food more and feel satisfied with less. Another aspect of mindful eating is paying attention to your body's signals of hunger and fullness. Stop eating when you feel comfortably full, even if there is still food on your plate."

Simply put, mindful eating involves paying close attention to what you're eating and how you're eating it. By doing so, you can better understand your body's signals of hunger and fullness, and make more conscious decisions about what to eat. One of the best ways to facilitate mindful eating is through the use of food logs.

But you can also get more specific by tracking things like the time of day, your mood, and your level of hunger before and after eating. The more information you record, the more insight you'll gain into your eating patterns. You might notice, for example, that you tend to eat more when you're feeling stressed or anxious, or that you tend to snack more in the evening.

A trigger food is something that you can't seem to resist or control yourself around, even though you know it's not good for you. Common trigger foods include things like sweets, salty snacks, and fast food. When you keep a food log, you'll be able to see how often you're eating these trigger foods, and under what circumstances. This can help you develop strategies to avoid these foods or find healthier alternatives. By being more mindful about what you're eating and why you're eating it, you'll find that you're able to make better choices and maintain a healthier lifestyle overall."
