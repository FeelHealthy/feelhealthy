      "value": "Emotional Intelligence (EI) refers to an individual's ability to recognize, understand and manage their emotions, as well as the emotions of others. Assessing an individual's level of emotional intelligence has become increasingly important in various fields including education, psychology, and business.

Behavioral measures are often considered more objective than self-report measures and can provide insight into an individual's actual emotional abilities as opposed to how they perceive themselves."

While the use of physiological measures to assess emotional intelligence is still in its early stages, it holds promise as a more objective and accurate method of assessing EI."
